# student-pairing-frontend
front end practice

We made 2 lists that were supposed to be placed on the screen next to each other so that the first name in the first list pairs with the first name in the second list.

We couldn't get the semantic ui to show the 2 lists of students in their columns to put the pairs next to each other. 
sorry about that.
